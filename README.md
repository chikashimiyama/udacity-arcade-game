## Game Story and your mission

The princess asked a lady thief to kidnap her in order to annul the marriage she doesn't want.

Your mission as **Lady Horn** is to acquire the princess, dodging the attacks by her footmen, housekeepers, and your rival villain **Lady Cat**.

You accomplish the mission, if you can acquire the princess without being caught by enemies (footmen, housekeepers and Lady Cat). If Lady Cat catches the princess before you reaches her, the mission also fails.
